# Hey, I'm Brian Silah!



### I'm a software engineer focused on development of customer focused scalable and security first solutions. I love musicðŸŽ¶ and a good laugh.

I am currently taking my studies in Bachelor of science in Computer Science at Riara university. I am currently working with java as my main language.Feel free to reach out if you want to colaborate on project.

As a former User Experience Designer, I'll always have a soft spot for design. The space between development and design is where I thrive.
