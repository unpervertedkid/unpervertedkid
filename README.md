- 👋 Hi, I’m Brian Silah. A young backend developer and designer. Growing up, technology amazed me. I would try and open up any  little gadget and try and figure out it working mechanism. The enthusiasm grew over time and it was obvious that my future was with tech.
- 👀 I’m interested in backend development, UI/UX design(I really love a good looking design thus the choice). My pasion to try and figure out how everything works led me to the bacdoor I guess😊
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Backend development with Java. I also am learning UX design.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects, learn new skills  get to show out my skills and keep up with the great developer community
